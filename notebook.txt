First we create a rec object that requires reading in 
all alignments. We need all alignments, as we need to 
consider all reads that belong a barcode-UMI. A UMI can 
have multiple duplicated reads, that can align anywhere 
in the genome. To assign an alignment to a UMI, we need 
to take all alignments into consideration, and thus need 
to pass through the entire genome.

Once we have read through all alignments, we 'call' the 
UMIs and assign the best alignment (or discard). Then 
we count UMIs to each gene.

We want the barcodes and UMIs in a Records struct to be 
hash tables, as filling in the Records struct from a BAM 
file will be MUCH faster. It is a little more memory 
intensive though.
